  <h1>Project Description</h1>
  <p>
    The project is a short interactive 360 movie that places the spectator in the body of a couple of tourists who visit a place called <i>The Pyramids of Vidy</i> located in the city of <i>Lausanne</i> in <i>Switzerland</i>.<br/>
    During the visit, something supernatural is happening that drives the tourists running away the place.
  </p>
  <p>
    The idea is to create two 360 films to allow the spectator switching its point of view to either tourist #1 or #2.<br/>
    To make those two films, I have 2 options :
    <ol>
      <li>Placing a 360 camera on each actor. But I don't have two cameras and even if I had two cameras, one will be visible by the other.</li>
      <li>Using one camera and make the film twice. This option requires to have same synchronization points. A clap is necessary on each scene and the actors placement must be very precise.</li>
    </ol>
    The option #2 seems more complicated but I like the challenge and I don't want to see the second camera. So, let's go for the option #2.
  </p>
  <p>The movie will bring emotions like joy visiting a nice place, surpise, stress and fear.</p>
  <h1>Pre-Production</h1>
  <h2>Locating the place</h2>
  <p>I used Google Map screenshots to have a good idea of the distances and to imagine the actors path and waypoints.</p>
  <p>Next I did few normal videos of the real location. This helped me to see what would be the landscape and how long could last the movie.</p>
